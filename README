 While poking around with pdspread in curses, I've been creating a few 
bits and pieces that may be useful for someone else learning curses. 

 Things like how to get the screen to scroll, how to play around with 
subwindows, how to get things updating in curses..... 

  So, just thought I'd pop these in a separate repo for people to find. 
 As  usual, all this stuff is "public domain".  

 "Share and enjoy....... "  ;)
